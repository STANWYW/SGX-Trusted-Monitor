REMOTE ATTESTATION ==================================================================
Hey~ Mingwei :)
use this test case for your remote attestation implementation..

1. run test/simple-attest first -> it busy waits ping message from the non_enclave
2. run non_enclave/attest_nonEnc -> it sends ping message to simple-attest
3. simple-attest will send result of sgx_report
4. attest_nonEnc receives it and print result.


FYI... we don't have thread supports in Enclave, so have some problem when we have
recv and send back to back. Make sure that process has some waits before calling send
to make other process be ready to recv.
check non_enclave/network_nonEnc & test/simple_network :)

RDRAND==============================================================================
Local hack for RDRAND COMPLETE
Use rdrand test case in this dir...
e.g.) ../qemu-x86-64 rdrand
It will get the random values from the hardware based random number pool
that is /dev/random ...

!!!SO FREQUENTLY CALL RDRAND INSTRUCTION COULD EXHAUSE YOUR PC'S ENTROPY 
!!!DO NOT CALL THAT INSTRUCTION CONTINUOSLY WITHOUT GENERATING ENTROPY...

TODO: WILL FIX ABOVE PROBELM SOON BUT IT SEEMS WORK WELL NOW..
